# IBAN Validation Service

Sets up a rudimentary API endpoint that will take an IBAN number and tell if it valid or not.

## Notice

This is the first program I have written in GO and it was at least 3 years since I used docker so do not use any of this repo without double checking security / performance.

## TODO's

- Start creating the service
